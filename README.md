# Pirate
Pirates always get their first choice P.E. class. That being said, it is highly inconvenient to wake up at 8:00 A.M. on P.E. registration day. Even if you are on your computer at precisely that time, you still might not get your first choice class. This scripts ensures that you get into your desired P.E. class without waking up. 

Simply enter the desired information, start the Python script the night before, and ensure that your computer doesn't go to sleep. Use at your own risk.
